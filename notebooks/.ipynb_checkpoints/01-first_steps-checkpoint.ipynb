    "- **interpreted**: the code of a python program is not compiled and translated into machine-language before execution, but rather translated line-by-line. We already have an example for this: the fact that we can have interactive notebooks! There is no real distinction between *compilation* and *runtime* like in compiled languages. A consequence of this is that computation-intensive operations are inherently inefficient (but we have libraries to get around this). \n",
    "- **strongly but dynamically typed**: variables have types, but this types are determined at *runtime*.   \n",
    "- **multi-paradigm**: python supports imperative, procedural, object-oriented and functional programming. Important to remember: every algorithm can be written in the form of sequences, selections (if) and loops!\n",
