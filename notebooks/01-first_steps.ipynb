    "Python is a programming language which is:\n",
    "- **interpreted**: the code of a python program is not compiled and translated into machine-language before execution, but rather translated line-by-line. We already have an example for this: the fact that we can have interactive notebooks! There is no real distinction between *compilation* and *runtime* like in compiled languages. A consequence of this is that computation-intensive operations are inherently inefficient (but we have libraries to get around this). \n",
    "- **strongly but dynamically typed**: variables have types, but this types are determined at *runtime*.   \n",
    "- **multi-paradigm**: python supports imperative, procedural, object-oriented and functional programming. Important to remember: every algorithm can be written in the form of sequences, selections (if) and loops!\n",

Important: **floating point** is a synonym of **variable precision**. This means that the resolution of your variable (i.e. the minimum difference between two values) depends on the order of magnitude of the number. Most of the times you will have enough precision for all practical purposes, but be aware that some numbers (especially decimals) may not have an exact representation!\n",
